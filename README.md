# Repository description
This repository is devoted to encompassing knowledge within the field of [Astrophotography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophotography).

## Why?
Why did I create the [Astrophotography](https://github.com/SoongVilda/Astrophotography) repository? I recently began exploring Astrophotography on my smartphone and found it to be quite enjoyable. While searching for information, I noticed a lack of polite guides for astrophotography on a smartphone. Therefore, I decided to create one myself and share it publicly so that everyone could read and benefit.

## MotionCam Pro
I really appreciate that app; it greatly assisted me in capturing my best-ever image of the Orion Nebula on my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. You can find the guide right here [MotionCam astro-guide](https://github.com/SoongVilda/Astrophotography/blob/main/MotionCam-repo/MotionCam-astro-guide.md)

## Sources of my knowledge
I discovered some places where there is a significant concentration of astrophotography knowledge.

### Astrobiscuit
- [astrobiscuit](https://astrobiscuit.com/) - I highly recommend exploring this website to anyone interested in starting to capture pictures of the night sky.
