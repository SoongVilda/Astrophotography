# Repository description
This repository is devoted to encompassing knowledge within the field of [Astrophotography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophotography).

## Why?
Why did I create the [Astrophotography](https://github.com/SoongVilda/Astrophotography) repository? I recently began exploring Astrophotography on my smartphone and found it to be quite enjoyable. While searching for information, I noticed a lack of polite guides for astrophotography on a smartphone. Therefore, I decided to create one myself and share it publicly so that everyone could read and benefit.

## Sources of my knowledge
I discovered some places where there is a significant concentration of astrophotography knowledge.
