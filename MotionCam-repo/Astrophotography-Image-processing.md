# Image processing
In this article, I will guide you through image processing. After reading, you may perceive images and pictures from a slightly different perspective.

## General image processing
**Let me quote Wikipedia - better than reinventing the wheel:** *Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to **process digital images through an algorithm**. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and distortion during processing. Since **images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more)** digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems. The generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors: first, the development of computers; second, the development of mathematics (especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory); third, the demand for a wide range of applications in environment, agriculture, military, industry and medical science has increased.*

## Astrophotography image processing
I personally identify a few key areas where image processing plays a role in astrophotography.
- **Improve images visually** - It tends to lean more towards art, as the primary objective is the visual aesthetics of images rather than scientific exploration.
- **Analyzing images** - It's akin to pure science, involving tasks such as discovering exoplanets, determining the temperature of stars, measuring the size of objects in space, and more.

## Popular methods
Here is a list of some commonly used methods in astrophotography for final image processing.
- Stacking - Enhancing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Calibration - Mitigate errors arising from the optical system, camera sensor, thermal fluctuations, and electronic noise.
- Wavelet transform-based sharpening
- Wavelet transform-based denoising
- Histogram stretching (Histogram equalization)
- Deconvolution - In mathematics, deconvolution is the inverse operation of convolution, particularly used to correct errors. For instance, it may be possible to recover the original signal after applying a filter (convolution) by utilizing a deconvolution method with a certain degree of accuracy.
