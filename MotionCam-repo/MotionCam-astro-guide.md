# Astrophotography with MotionCam Pro
I've achieved significant success with MotionCam and the Galaxy S23 Ultra in the field of astrophotography. Consequently, I've created a guide for anyone who owns a phone with a substantial optical zoom, such as the Galaxy S21 Ultra, S22 Ultra, or S23 Ultra.  

Many phones today are equipped with 5x optical zoom, along with significantly improved sensors and optics compared to the S21 Ultra, S22 Ultra, and S23 Ultra. Therefore, after cropping the image, the results could be quite comparable.  

This applies to phones like the Google Pixel 6, 7, 8 Pro, or Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, 12S Ultra, or 13 Ultra, and so on.

# Short theory behind astrophotography
Reconsider much of what you know about traditional photography; it proves ineffective in astrophotography. Bear in mind that the captured data and the light passing through the lens to reach your sensor are the most crucial elements. The intelligent features of your phone or camera will not be of substantial assistance. Even high-end professional cameras with full-frame sensors can generate significant amounts of noise.

# Set up the MotionCam app before you point your phone at the night sky
There are a few basic principles you need to follow:
- Capturing raw data without making any corrections is crucial.
- You need to adjust your telephoto lens, as it is ideal for photographing the Moon or capturing deep-sky objects such as the Orion Nebula (M42) or Andromeda Galaxy (M31).
	+ Disable OIS
	+ Enable Expert viewfinder - *important to set proper exposure time and ISO.*
 	+ Disable noise reduction
	+ Disable Sharpness
	+ Disable vingette correction
	+ Enable Remove vignette correction data
- Tools
	+ Enable Show RAW histogram
	+ Enable Focus peaking
	+ Sensitivity to noise - *will be utilized later. Feel free to play around with it a bit to become familiar with how this feature functions.*
## Screenshot with settings
A screenshot displaying the aforementioned settings is provided below.

# Choose objects to shoot
Selecting the right object to shoot always depends on your available focal length in millimeters. Don't be disheartened by a shorter focal length, as it implies less optical magnification. Sometimes, extensive focal lengths, like 300mm and more, aren't necessarily the best choice. 

## Two fields of astrophotography
- **Deep-Sky Imaging:** This category includes objects beyond our Solar system, such as galaxies, nebulas, glowing dust, constellations, groups of galaxies, and more.
> *This usually requires either a shorter focal length or a very long focal length.*
- **Planetary Imaging (or Solar System Imaging):** This pertains to objects within our Solar system, including our moon, planets and their moons, comets, and so on.
> *This usually requires a longer focal length.*

### If you own a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, S22 Ultra, or S23 Ultra
These three models come equipped with a camera featuring 10x optical magnification, equivalent to a 230mm lens! This is advantageous, providing you with access to a reasonably extensive list of objects with any of these three smartphones.
- **Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra** - `10 MP, f/4.9, 240mm (periscope telephoto), 1/3.24", 1.22µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 10x optical zoom`
- **Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra** - `10 MP, f/4.9, 230mm (periscope telephoto), 1/3.52", 1.12µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 10x optical zoom`
- **Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra** - `10 MP, f/4.9, 230mm (periscope telephoto), 1/3.52", 1.12µm, Dual Pixel PDAF, OIS, 10x optical zoom`

### List of objects suitable for beginners
1. **The Moon** is a truly easy target; I personally captured it with the S22U, S23U. Everyone knows it, and it's easy to find in the sky during any season of the year, regardless of light pollution and other factors.
> *A perfect opportunity for a 10x camera.*
2. **Orion Nebula (M41)**, a pretty well-visible deep-sky object with the naked eye, no problem for a 10x camera. Living in Europe, I can only spot Orion in the winter sky, and as a result, my hands are always freezing.
> *A perfect opportunity for a 10x camera.*
3. **Andromeda Galaxy (M31)** Similar to the Orion Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy is just slightly less visible, making it a challenge to spot with the naked eye in the city. I recommend traveling to the outskirts of the city or visiting a location with a darker sky, such as your grandparents' village. In such conditions, there should be no problem seeing the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye!
> *A perfect opportunity for a 10x camera.*

## If you have a device with 5x zoom or higher
Yes, the night sky is large, and some objects are hidden from the naked eye, but they still exist, and you can capture them with shorter focal lengths.

### List of objects suitable for beginners
1. **Orion Nebula (M41)**, a quite visible deep-sky object with the naked eye, poses no challenge for a 5x camera. The Orion constellation encompasses not only the Orion Nebula but also numerous bright stars, glowing dust, and the Horsehead Nebula. 
> *It's well-suited for a 120mm lens; even a 70mm lens would be sufficient.*
2. **Andromeda Galaxy (M31)** Similar to the Orion Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy is just slightly less visible, making it a challenge to spot with the naked eye in the city. I recommend traveling to the outskirts of the city or visiting a location with a darker sky, such as your grandparents' village. In such conditions, there should be no problem seeing the Andromeda Galaxy with the naked eye!
> *It's well-suited for a 120mm lens*
3. **The Moon** is a truly easy target; I personally captured it with the S22U, S23U. Everyone knows it, and it's easy to find in the sky during any season of the year, regardless of light pollution and other factors. 
> *The moon through a 120mm lens represents a unique challenge; achieving perfect focus is crucial, but once achieved, it is possible to capture a clear image.*

#### Google
- **Google Pixel 6 Pro** - `48 MP, f/3.5, 104mm (telephoto), 1/2", 0.8µm, PDAF, OIS, 4x optical zoom`
- **Google Pixel 7 Pro** - `48 MP, f/3.5, 120mm (telephoto), 1/2.55", 0.7µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom`
- **Google Pixel 8 Pro** - `48 MP, f/2.8, 113mm (telephoto), 1/2.55", 0.7µm, dual pixel PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom`

#### Xiaomi
- **Xiaomi Mi 10 Ultra** - `48 MP, f/4.1, 120mm (periscope telephoto), 1/2.0", 0.8µm, PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom`
- **Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra** - `48 MP, f/4.1, 120mm (periscope telephoto), 1/2.0", 0.8µm, PDAF, OIS, 5x optical zoom`

# Capturing process
This is a description of the image-capturing process using MotionCam.

## Moon
The Moon is relatively easy to capture and serves as the best example for each step of the capturing process.

#### 1. Mount your smartphone on a tripod 
- Your smartphone needs to be steady and stable.
  
#### 2. Finding the Moon
- It might sound amusing and unusual, but locating an object in the night sky with a longer focal length can be challenging. I sometimes use my 3x (70mm lens) to find the Moon more quickly.

#### 3. Adjust the zoom on your viewfinder 
- Even at 10x optical zoom (230mm lens), the Moon appears small, and it's challenging to Identify any surface details.

#### 4. Perfect focus on the Moon 
- The **Focus peaking** feature is crucial for successfully focusing on the Moon's surface.

#### 5. Setting exposure time and ISO
- As soon as you do Planetary Imaging (or Solar System Imaging), always use the lowest possible ISO and only change exposure. Increasing exposure until a red area (Indication of over-exposing) appears on the Moon's surface. You mustn't overexpose your image; otherwise, you will lose details. I always hold a little bit back before the red area appears. I want to be sure nothing, even the edges of craters which are pretty bright and sharp won't be overexposed.

#### 6. Raw video 
- Don't forget to use **RAW VIDEO** mode. Now, you can start capturing until the Moon moves out of the zoomed viewfinder. Try to capture the Moon as close to the center of the frame as possible!
> Q: How many frames should I capture?  
> A: Capturing 500 frames should suffice. However, for the best possible quality - consider capturing 1000 frames.

## Screenshots of capturing the Moon
- Screenshot 1 - Finding the Moon
- Screenshot 2 - Zooming of viewfinder
- Screenshot 3 - Example of unfocused image
- Screenshot 4 - Example of a perfectly focused image: I was pleasantly surprised by the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's automatic focusing capabilities - it did a great job. I even tried manually adjusting the focus, and I ended up with the exact same results, regardless of the focus peaking indicator
